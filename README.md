# Sales & Revenue Optimization Dashboard Project

## Project Overview

This is a data analytics project focused on sales and operational performance. I used SQL to process data from multiple CSV files, performed a small amount of data cleaning in Excel, and visualized key business insights in Tableau. The goal was to simulate the type of work I would do in a real-world analyst role and showcase it on my resume and GitHub profile.

## Business Questions Answered

- **What is our total and average order value by month?**  
  Helps monitor sales trends and seasonal fluctuations.

- **Which products bring in the most revenue?**  
  Guides inventory and marketing efforts toward top-performing items.

- **Which regions generate the most sales?**  
  Informs regional expansion or investment strategies.

- **How many customers are we serving in each region?**  
  Assesses customer reach and geographic performance.

- **Which stores sell the most units?**  
  Identifies high-performing locations.

- **Which employees process the most orders?**  
  Useful for performance evaluations and staffing decisions.

## Excel Data Cleaning

Before loading the data into SQL Server:

- Empty cells were replaced with `NULL` where appropriate.  
- Some column types were standardized (e.g., `zip_code`, `manager_id`).  
- Cleaned versions of `customers`, `orders`, and `staffs` files were used.

## SQL Process & Queries

- Imported 9 related CSV files and created normalized tables.  
- Defined primary and foreign keys to establish relationships.  
- Wrote 8 SQL queries to answer relevant business questions (see above).  
- Exported query results to CSV for use in Tableau.
